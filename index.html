    Take 4 of my CP 5, this time a very simple game. This is a single page app, the default view
    is the "signup"/"login" screen, taking in a user's info and making them an account in the
    database. After a successful registration (add to database) or login (matched a row in the
    database), it changes view to the game, a very simple one guessing a button to push. After the
    game is over the user has the option to add their listing to the high scores.
